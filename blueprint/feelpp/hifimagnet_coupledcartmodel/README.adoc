The "upload" is uploaded on the orchestrator

WARNING: Don't put your local in the upload directory to not upload your user/pass

You can copy the singularity image in your ${LUSTRE} folder if it's not available
the ${SINGULARITY_REPO} directory. (module load singularity on ft2)

Connect to the cloudify client via docker.
See https://github.com/MSO4SC/MSOOrchestrator-CLI/blob/master/README.adoc

Set your local blueprint file (user/password) at the root of the cloned repository
named "local-blueprint-inputs.yaml" (It is ignored by git, then you won't risk to push
it on the remote repository)
See http://book.mso4sc.cemosis.fr/#mso4sc_tosca_modelling_and_execution

NOTE: If the application fails during one step of the deploy up process, you'll have to
force cancel execution by hands. `cfy executions list`, `cfy executions cancel -f <id>`
