= {hifimagnet} basic workflow TOSCA

This is the basic demonstrator of {hifimagnet} workflow for ThermoElectric simulations
of High Field Magnets.

It actually run a 3D non-linear thermo-electric model on a benchmark geometry.

== Running in the orchestrator CLI

* Create a `local-blueprint-inputs.yaml` from the template file.
** Define the HPC ressource you are planning to use.
** Enter your credentials (`user/passwd`)
** Setup <<inputs, input parameters>>

* Connect to the cloudify client via docker:
[source]
----
docker pull mso4sc/msoorchestrator-cli
docker run -it --rm \
    -v $HOME/MSO4SC/resources:/resources \
     mso4sc/msoorchestrator-cli
----

* Within the docker:
[source]
----
cfy profiles use  ORCHESTRATOR_IP -t  default_tenant -u USER -p PASSWD
----

Then you can simply deploy your application using:
[source]
----
./deploy up
----

To undeploy on the orchestrator, just:
[source]
----
./deploy down
----

NOTE: If the application fails during one step of the deploy up process, you'll have to
force cancel execution by hands. `cfy executions list`, `cfy executions cancel -f <id>`
in the orchestrator client (*docker).

[TIP]
====
Some useful commands :

* `cfy status`
* `cfy deployment list`
* `cfy deployment delete -f <name>`
* `cfy execution list`
* `cfy execution cancel -f <id>
* `cfy deployment delete -f <name>`
* `cfy blueprint list`
* `cfy blueprint delete <name>`

== Package workflow for {MSO4SC} portal

To package the workflow for latter use in the portal, just create a gzipped archive `hifimagnet_test.tgz`
using :
[source]
----
./deploy pkg
----

[#inputs]
== Input parameters

The main parameters are noted in **bold**

=== HPC settings

=== Simulation setup

=== Singularity images

== Synopsis

* deploy:
** load singularity {hifimagnet} image
** eventually load dataset from CKAN URL
** perform a few checks [TODO]

* running:
** move to base_dir/workdir_tmp_ID
** submit batch prefix_ID using workload manager

* undeploy:
** eventually cleanup base_dir/workir_prefix_ID
** eventually cleanup singularity image
** remove loaded dataset
